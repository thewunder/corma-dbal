# Corma DBAL

A fork of the excellent [Doctrine DBAL](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal), a powerful database abstraction layer with some
QueryBuilder features removed in the 4.0 release restored.

See their quite ample [documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/4.0/index.html) for more information.
